You are conducting defensible WCAG-EM page sampling for a client that cares deeply about evaluating their accessibility honestly. They are only interested in the domains or subdomains provided. Do not explore external domains. 

Accuracy and traceability are mandatory.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Evaluate coverage of the provided URL list.
Expand the list using only verifiable, directly observed links.
Produce clean URL lists suitable for audit documentation.

HARD VALIDATION CONSTRAINTS

You may only include additional URLs if:

• The URL was extracted directly from an HTML anchor tag (<a>) visible on a page you accessed.
• The page returns HTTP 200.
• The page renders as HTML.
• The URL is fully qualified and exact.
• The page is publicly accessible without authentication.
• It is unique and not redirected or duplicate content.

You may NOT:

• Invent URLs.
• Infer URLs from naming conventions.
• Modify URL paths manually.
• Include URLs you did not directly observe in anchor tags.
• List domains which are outside of the domain or sub-domain provided in the list.

If browsing limitations prevent validation, explicitly state that and do not fabricate results.

DISCOVERY TRACE REQUIREMENT

For every additional URL discovered, you must record the navigation path using this format:

[Source Page URL]
→ Anchor text clicked
→ Destination URL

This trace must be shown before the Section 2 URL list.

No speculation. Only observed navigation steps.

Treat www and non-www URLs as the same. Often redirects are not set up properly. 

SCOPE REQUIREMENTS

Sampling must cover:

• Primary user journeys
• News/article templates
• Topic landing pages
• Program or office landing pages
• Policy and compliance pages
• Accessibility-related pages
• Search results pages
• Forms and transactional workflows
• Filtering and pagination templates
• Dynamic content
• Data tables
• Legacy or structurally distinct templates

Exclude:

• PDFs
• Office documents
• Media files
• 404 pages
• Redirect shells unless evaluating the resolved HTML page

OUTPUT STRUCTURE

SECTION 1 — Original List Evaluation

Provide a concise summary describing:

• The types of user tasks represented
• The types of templates covered
• The types of functionality included
• Major interaction categories represented

Keep this analytical and high level.
Do not list URLs here.

SECTION 2 — Additional Verified Pages (High Priority)

First: Discovery Trace Log

For each newly discovered URL, list:

[Source URL]
→ Anchor text
→ Destination URL

Then:

Verified Additional URLs only.
One URL per line.
No commentary.
No duplication. Having https://example.com/a and https://www.example.com/a is a duplication
Try to be consistent with the original list with the use of "www." or non-www.
Aim for 20-40% more URLs than provided.

SECTION 3 — Redundant Pages (Low Priority)

From the list of URLs provided, list those that appear structurally duplicative. Show what can be safely deleted.
URLs only.
One per line.
No commentary.
If there is no duplication, say so.
Do not add or remove "www." from the beginning of the URL from the list provided.

SECTION 4 — Minimal WCAG-EM Manual Sample (Medium Priority)

Optimized for deep manual evaluation.

Must include:

• Home page
• Accessibility statement
• Search results page
• Contact forms
* About pages
• At least one complex form
• At least one dynamic listing/filter page
• At least one policy/compliance page
• At least one high-density structured content page

URLs only.
One per line.
At least 25 URLs.
